# Fortune Cookie üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Mist


### Team Members
Niranjan S (GEC Kozhikode)

### Project Description
Fortune Cookie is a fun web app that displays a random fortune message each time you open a virtual cookie. Users can interact with the animation, receive motivational or humorous fortunes, and share their results. The project combines playful design with simple interactivity to bring smiles and inspiration to users.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People everywhere are suffering from a lack of daily surprises and smiles. Opening a real fortune cookie is rare, and motivational messages are hard to come by in a fun way. How can we bring a little joy and randomness to everyone‚Äôs day, anytime, anywhere?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a virtual fortune cookie that anyone can open with a click! Our web app delivers random, uplifting, or funny fortunes with a delightful animation, making every visit a new experience. Now, everyone can enjoy a daily dose of surprise and positivity‚Äîno bakery required!
